          Hello, my name is Mons, I am 22 years old, and I come from Brandbu, Hadeland. I am currently in my final year
          of my bachelor's degree in web development (BWU) at NTNU in Gjøvik. Since I was young, I have always felt a
          great enthusiasm for technology. I was fascinated by all the exciting things that could be achieved through
          science and innovation. This fascination has always driven me, and I have always had a deep desire to
          contribute to shaping the future of human technological development. These thoughts led me to choose to study
          web development because I see the potential it can have on the world as digital integration with people
          becomes more and more prominent. Throughout these three years, I have gained a lot of knowledge in front-end
          and back-end technologies and UX. In my free time, I enjoy gaming and having fun, AI, and science, and I would
          love to engage others in my interests. I work well in teams but can also work independently. If you see
          potential in me, please feel free to contact me!
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-50">
          I created this project together with my group as a prototype, along with a proof of concept website. It aimed
          to simulate an app that could be used to scan items placed in the refrigerator. The idea was that by being
          able to see an overview of the refrigerator's contents, one could limit purchases of items already present in
          the fridge that might have been forgotten. This could help reduce food waste. Originally, the plan was to use
          a Raspberry Pi connected to a scanner to list the items as they were placed in the fridge. However, due to the
          lack of a Raspberry Pi, we decided to use a barcode scanner linked to an Express app with EJS instead.

        <p class="text-gray-50">
          As part of the frontend team for the website "Avgangsutstilling 2023" (Graduation Exhibition 2023), I had an
          important task of effectively showcasing the design that other classes had worked on and prototyped. My main
          responsibility was to enhance the layout, appearance, and animations on certain pages to make the site as
          user-friendly as possible.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-50">
          The website was developed using technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, MDX, and Tailwind CSS. It was a
          collaborative process involving the Bachelor's programs in Web Development, Interaction Design, and Graphic
          Design.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-50">
          Disclaimer: I was only part of the design process for Avgangsutstilling 2023. If you view this later than 2023
          the page might look different. Add /historisk after the url to access the previous versions of the website.
          Then
          click 2023.

        <p class="text-gray-50">
          As part of my bachelor's thesis, my group and I developed an app over a semester period. The app uses local
          stories to engage people in sharing and spreading love for their hometowns and also motivates visitors to
          explore what it means to be a pilgrim. The solution includes a section dedicated to people interested in
          hiking a pilgrimage trail, where they can find useful information to make the journey easier. Yggdrasil also
          features a map page where users can add markers for attractions and stories they want to share with others.
